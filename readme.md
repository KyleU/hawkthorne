# Hawkthorne

Hawkthorne is a pure Scala reactive web application built on Play 2.6,
Scala.js, Silhouette 5, Akka, Sangria, and postgres-async. It extends some of the work found in [Boilerplay](https://)

## Running the app

First, change the database section of application.conf to use your existing database credentials.

You'll either need Node.js available as "node" on the path, or change project/Server.scala's EngineType to Rhino.

Now, finally,
```shell
$ sbt
> run
$ open http://127.0.0.1:9000
```

As the application starts, it will create database tables and seed data.

The first account to sign up is created as an Admin, all subsequent users will have a normal user role.
