# Hawkthorne

[https://hawkthorne.net](https://hawkthorne.net)

Hawkthorne is a web game based on the Community episode "[Digital Estate Planning](EpisodeS03E20)".

The project is written in pure Scala, using assets and logic from [Digital Estate Planning: The Game](https://github.com/hawkthorne/hawkthorne-journey), an open source project.

## Running the app

First, change the database section of application.conf to use your existing database credentials.

You'll either need Node.js available as "node" on the path, or change project/Server.scala's EngineType to Rhino.

Now, finally,
```shell
$ sbt
> run
$ open http://127.0.0.1:9000
```

As the application starts, it will create database tables and seed data.

The first account to sign up is created as an Admin, all subsequent users will have a normal user role.
